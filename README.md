# Codex-Kernel

Codex mainly focuses on stability and security. The main aim of this kernel is to always be up to date with CAF upstream.  

## Bugs that needs to be addressed
- ###### WiFi (Will be fixed soon! WIP)
- ###### Camera (Broken source by Xiaomi)
- ###### Torch (Broken source by Xiaomi)
- ###### Brightness (Stays bright even in low brightness, again by Xiaomi)

## Need some features?
Ah, everyone likes to experience new features. If you want me to add something new, let me know. I'll always look into users concerns though I can't guarantee in adding them (if they break the stability).
